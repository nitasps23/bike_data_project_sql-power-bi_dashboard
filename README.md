### Bike Share Dashboard (Power BI+SQL):
> The project aims to assess the feasibility of a price increase for the bike shop the following year. The process involves building a database to store the data, developing SQL queries to extract and transform the data, connecting the database to Power BI, and creating the dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends, ultimately providing analysis and recommendations on whether a price increase is viable.
